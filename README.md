TwitPort is a mass reporter that uses lists of targets and automatically reports them.

# Fair enough, HOW DO I INSTALL IT?
1) Click the official link at the top of this page.
2) Go to chrome://extensions
3) Drag .crx onto screen
4) TwitPort is now installed.
5) Click the little icon when you're logged in to start mass reporting.

# How TF do I edit my lists?!
It's simple, right click the icon and click options.

# How TF do I create my own list?
1) Go on GhostBin or Pastebin
2) Type in names without the @ (one line each)
3) Save the paste, copy the link, go the options and update the url.

# I GOT A FUCKING QUESTION YOU DIDN'T ANSWER GARRR
